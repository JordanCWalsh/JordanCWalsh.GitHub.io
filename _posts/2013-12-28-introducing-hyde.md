* My education has an equal emphasis on software engineering and game development. The challenges I encountered developing software for 2D and 3D game worlds has better prepared me for solving the complex data structure problems that come with the enterprise scale engineering world. Game design and development have also granted me a good eye for presenting application UI's in a clean, intuitive and fun way.
