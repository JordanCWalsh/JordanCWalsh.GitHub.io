### Intro

- Hello ðŸ‘‹ So you found my software engineering project-site. You might be wondering if I would be great fit for your engineering team. So let me introduce myself:
- I am a full-stack software engineer with experience developing, testing, debugging and deploying enterprise scale web applications. I have experience woring in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, ES6 JavaScript frameworks, SQL databases and more. I have developed features for both internal and customer facing web applications.
- Simply put, I enjoy creating software! There are interesting challenges to solve at every turn, and I look forward to finding the most valuable solution for the job. Every week I stay busy architecting, planning, learning, writing, testing, optimizing and deploying. I look forward to celebrating every challenge my team and I overcome as the application grows!
- A little bit of my history: I originally went to school to be a teacher. I have always been facinated by computer science, ever since taking 3 semesters of AutoCAD & 3D-modeling in high school. But I fell in love with software development in 2012 (while tinkering around with Python and Ruby scripts instead of doing my homework) and never looked back.
